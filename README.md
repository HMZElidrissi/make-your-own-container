# Make your own Container from scratch

This is a simple script to create a container from scratch using Linux namespaces and cgroups. It demonstrates how to create a new process in a new namespace, set up cgroups for resource management, and run a command inside the container.

- make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x create-container.sh
```
- run the script
```bash
./create-container.sh
```
